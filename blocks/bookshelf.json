    "interaction.message": "An excerpt from \"The Legend of the 10 Elemental Masters\" by Nick Smith (ulillillia):\n\nKnuckles resembles a human, but with differences. Knuckles is neither male nor female, though referred to as a \"he\". Three-quarter-inch-thick dark-violet-colored (FFA000E0) fur covers his entire body. He is only 25 1/3 inches tall, 4 inches wide and 2.5 inches deep. Knuckles gets his name from his large hands, 40% bigger than a human his size would have. A reflective, glittery greenish (FFA0FF00) haze a half millimeter across borders his pupil. Knuckles has no nose and a mouth 2/3 as big. Every other aspect of his is that of what a human would have for his size."
